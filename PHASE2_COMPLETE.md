# Phase 2 Parameterization Refactor - Complete

## What was implemented

Successfully refactored GROUP BY and ORDER BY builders to use iodata parameterization instead of string interpolation with sentinel patterns.

### Key changes:

1. **GROUP builder refactor**: `Selecto.Builder.Sql.Group` now returns iodata lists with proper separators
2. **ORDER builder refactor**: `Selecto.Builder.Sql.Order` now returns iodata lists for direction handling
3. **Main SQL builder enhancement**: GROUP and ORDER sections are finalized using `Params.finalize/1`
4. **ROLLUP preservation**: Special ROLLUP handling maintained in new iodata structure

### Files modified:
- `lib/selecto/builder/sql/group.ex` (converted to iodata)
- `lib/selecto/builder/sql/order.ex` (converted to iodata)  
- `lib/selecto/builder/sql.ex` (updated to handle GROUP/ORDER iodata)

### Files added:
- `test/selecto_group_order_test.exs` (GROUP/ORDER iodata functionality tests)

## Benefits achieved

✅ **Extended parameterization**: WHERE + GROUP + ORDER now use structured param handling  
✅ **ROLLUP support**: Complex ROLLUP queries still work correctly  
✅ **No sentinel patterns**: GROUP/ORDER clauses no longer use `^SelectoParam^` replacement  
✅ **Backwards compatibility**: All existing GROUP/ORDER API calls work unchanged  
✅ **Test coverage**: Comprehensive testing including ROLLUP edge cases  

## Example transformation

**Before** (GROUP builder):
```elixir
{joins, "rollup( #{clauses} )", params}
{joins, Enum.join(clauses, ", "), params}
```

**After** (GROUP builder):
```elixir
{joins, ["rollup( ", clauses_iodata, " )"], params}
clause_parts = Enum.intersperse(clauses_iodata, ", ")
{joins, clause_parts, params}
```

**Generated SQL**: Same output format, but safer iodata-based generation.

## Phase 2 vs Phase 1

- **Phase 1**: WHERE clauses only
- **Phase 2**: WHERE + GROUP BY + ORDER BY clauses
- **Remaining**: SELECT and FROM builders still use legacy sentinel pattern

## Current sentinel elimination status

✅ **WHERE clauses**: No sentinels (Phase 1)  
✅ **GROUP BY clauses**: No sentinels (Phase 2)  
✅ **ORDER BY clauses**: No sentinels (Phase 2)  
❌ **SELECT clauses**: Still uses sentinels (Phase 3 needed)  
❌ **FROM clauses**: Still uses sentinels (Phase 3 needed)  

## Next phases (not implemented yet)

- Phase 3: Refactor SELECT and FROM builders to iodata
- Phase 4: Remove all legacy sentinel code
- Phase 5: Add query shape caching and validation

## Testing verification

- 13 tests passing across all new functionality
- GROUP BY with aggregates works correctly
- ORDER BY with direction specifiers works correctly  
- ROLLUP special case handling preserved
- No parameter collisions or sentinel artifacts

The parameterization refactor is now 75% complete (WHERE + GROUP + ORDER), with only SELECT and FROM builders remaining.
