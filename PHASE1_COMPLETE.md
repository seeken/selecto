# Phase 1 Parameterization Refactor - Complete

## What was implemented

Successfully refactored the sentinel substitution pattern (`^SelectoParam^`) for WHERE clauses to use structured iodata with param markers.

### Key changes:

1. **New module**: `Selecto.SQL.Params` - handles finalization of iodata with `{:param, value}` markers into SQL + params list
2. **WHERE builder refactor**: All WHERE clause builders now return iodata lists with `{:param, value}` instead of sentinel strings
3. **Main SQL builder update**: WHERE section is finalized early while preserving legacy sentinel handling for SELECT/FROM/GROUP/ORDER

### Files modified:
- `lib/selecto/sql/params.ex` (new)
- `lib/selecto/builder/sql.ex` (refactored build/2)
- `lib/selecto/builder/sql/where.ex` (all build functions)

### Files added:
- `test/selecto_sql_params_test.exs` (unit tests for param finalizer)
- `test/selecto_where_iodata_test.exs` (WHERE builder iodata tests)
- `test/selecto_integration_test.exs` (full SQL generation test)

## Benefits achieved

✅ **No collision risk**: Eliminated brittle string replacement pattern  
✅ **Structured params**: WHERE clauses now use proper param markers  
✅ **Backwards compatibility**: Legacy code (SELECT/FROM/GROUP/ORDER) still works  
✅ **Test coverage**: Comprehensive testing of new parameter handling  
✅ **Performance**: No change in performance, potentially faster due to less string manipulation  

## Example transformation

**Before** (WHERE builder):
```elixir
{joins, " #{sel} = ^SelectoParam^ ", param ++ [value]}
```

**After** (WHERE builder):
```elixir
{joins, [" ", sel, " = ", {:param, value}, " "], param}
```

**Generated SQL**: Same `$1, $2, $3` format, but safer generation path.

## Next phases (not implemented yet)

- Phase 2: Refactor ORDER/GROUP builders to iodata
- Phase 3: Refactor SELECT builders to iodata  
- Phase 4: Remove legacy sentinel code entirely
- Phase 5: Add query shape caching

## Migration notes

- All existing Selecto API calls work unchanged
- Internal WHERE parameter handling is completely different but transparent
- No breaking changes to public interface
- Tests pass (unit tests for param system + integration test verifying full SQL generation)

The sentinel substitution vulnerability has been eliminated for WHERE clauses while maintaining full compatibility.
